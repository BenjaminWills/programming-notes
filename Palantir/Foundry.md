# Key foundry strengths

Foundry enables **Data Engineers** and **Operational Users** to work on the same platform via a wrapper named as the **ontology**. Its aim is to connect the world of `operations` ton the world of `analytics` in one platform.

## The Ontology

Creating the `Ontology` is a 2 step process

1. Add raw data into the `Ontology`
2. Make it presentable to non technical users

The `Ontology` unifies all data sources into one location. It is made up of `objects`,`relations`, `actions` and `models` and holds the whole project accountable to a single source of truth. Basically just the hub of operations. It allows for visualisations of data `pipelines` that allow users to see what is happening to their data.

## Overview

`Foundary` is a `fully managed` `saas` platform that spans from:

- `cloud hosting`
- `data integration`
- `flexible analyitics`
- `visualisation`
- `model building`

to name a few. It is also `modular` meaning that it is very versatile. Can be directly integrated via `APIs`.

`Foundary` has both `code` and `no-code` options when it comes to creating your applications.

why should we use this?

- Has `200+` data connectors and `automated pipeline generation`
- Collaboration across skillsets with both `code` and `no-code` pipeline building
- Automates governance workflows with `data lineage`, `embedded data health checks` and `integrated granular security`
- Allows for economies of scale with `auto scaling cloud compute` with `UI's` for less technically experienced folk
- Easy to manage and add to the workflow as all of the resources are on the `Ontology`
- `Foundary` is mega `secure` offering features such as:
	- Encryption in transit and at rest
	- Data security controls i.e `roles` and `granular permissions`
	- Data privacy features i.e `aggregation`, `anonymisation`
	- `Certifications` for certain services
