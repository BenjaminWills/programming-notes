# Prompt engineering for large language models

It is very important to know how to interact with `LLMs` to get the most out of each and every API call.

A few interesting things to consider when asking an `LLM` a question:

1. What context are you asking about? 
2. In what style should the model answer?
3. Are there any references that you wish the model to use?
