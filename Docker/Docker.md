# What is docker

Docker is an application that allows for the creation of `containers` that run applications, these containers are `virtual machines` meaning that they act like a machine even though they are just a partition of your pc. This is mega useful, as it allows us to create `images` that `containers` are built off of. For instance, you could run a whole application out of a cluster of `docker containers`, one for each element such as API, frontend, backend etc. Right now this sounds like black magic but it is actually more simple than you may think.
